#Project Notes

220210 - VS Environment setup not working for me. Had to revert to PyCharm. Unable to commit. VS Code output window not working. Added the get_document module that finds document and extracts the standard names from the document. Unable to test as VS output and VS terminal does not work. Need to examine how to work with virtual environment in PyCharm. Try again tomorrow.
